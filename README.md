# AI TicTacToe & Connect 4
This repository contains the implementation of an AI that plays Connect 4 and TicTacToe. The AI is capable of playing using several strategies like minimax, Q-learning, and a smart random selection. The code leverages the pygame library for game visualization. 

# Getting Started
Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). 
The code also requires the following Python libraries: numpy, random, pygame, sys, math, collections, and tkinter. If you don't have these libraries installed, you can install them using pip.

To run the programm locally, the repo needs to be cloned. This can be done by entering in the following command into the terminal:
git clone https://github.com/joycej3/AI-TicTacToe-Connect4

### Installing Python Libraries

Here are the commands to install the necessary libraries:

pip install numpy
pip install pygame

## Runinng the Code
### Tic Tac Toe
Change the hardcoded values in the top of the tictactoe.py file to determine the behaviour of the program.This can be done by commenting out the undesired player starategy and then including the desired one by uncommenting it. The number of games played and the reinforced learning algorithm used by each player can be changed here

To run the code, type pyton tictactoe.py in the terminal

### Connect 4
Change the hardcoded values in the top of the connect4.py file to determine the behaviour of the program. This can be done by commenting out the undesired player starategy and then including the desired one by uncommenting it. The number of games played and the reinforced learning algorithm used by each player can be changed here

To run the code, type pyton tictactoe.py in the terminal
